# Hello Handwriting

## About

"Hello Handwriting" is a simple project which can train a Neural Network to recognize simple handwritten digits, and then test the network either against training data or against your own handwritten digits.

## Getting Started

To run the project simply download the repo and and run

```shell
python learn.py
```

This script will automatically download the training and testing data from [MNSIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) and train the network to decipher the images.


## TODO

* Fill out setup, installation, and learning, challenges, motivations, learnings and testing README
* Connect Paint program to trained neural network
* Create a wrapper UI around the paint program
* (Optional) Create a wrapper UI around the Machine Learning
